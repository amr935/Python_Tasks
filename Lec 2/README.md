# 💻 Python Practice Tasks – Conditionals & Loops

Welcome to this beginner-friendly Python project repository! This collection includes two fundamental Python programs that help reinforce the concepts of conditional statements and loops.

---

## ✅ Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

**📄 File Name**: `assign_2_a.py`

### 🔹 Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Uses an `if-else` statement to check if the number is even or odd.
3. Displays an appropriate message based on the result.

### 🔹 Python Concepts Used:
- User input
- Type conversion
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Modulus operator (`%`)

### 🔹 Sample Output:
Enter a number: 5
5 is an odd number.

## ✅ Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

**📄 File Name**: `assign_2_b.py`

### 🔹 Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Calculates the cumulative sum of all integers in the range.
3. Prints the final sum at the end.

### 🔹 Python Concepts Used:
- Loops (`for`)
- Ranges
- Accumulators (sum variables)
- Output formatting

### 🔹 Sample Output:
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
