# Python Programs

This repository contains two beginner-friendly Python programs that demonstrate the use of conditional statements and loops.

## 🧠 Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### ✅ Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

### 💻 Sample Output:
Enter a number:2
2 is an even number.
Enter a number:7
7 is an odd number.

## 🔢 Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

### ✅ Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3. Displays the final sum.

### 💻 Sample Output:
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
