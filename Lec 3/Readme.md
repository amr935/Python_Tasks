# 🐍 Python Basic Programs: Factorial & Math Module Calculations

Welcome to my Python mini-project! 👨‍💻  
This repository contains two beginner-friendly Python programs that demonstrate core programming concepts such as functions, loops/recursion, user input handling, and usage of the built-in `math` module.

---

## 📌 Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### ✅ Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:

1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument.
2. Calculates the factorial of the number using a loop or recursion.
3. Returns the calculated factorial.
4. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the result.

### 🔁 Sample Output:

Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120



## 📌 Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### ✅ Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:

1. Asks the user to enter a number.
2. Uses Python's built-in `math` module to calculate the:
   - ✅ Square root of the number
   - ✅ Natural logarithm (log base *e*) of the number
   - ✅ Sine of the number (in radians)
3. Displays all the calculated results in a clear format.

### 🔁 Sample Output:
Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303



# Displaying results
print(f"Square root: {square_root}")
print(f"Logarithm: {logarithm}")
print(f"Sine: {sine_value}")
